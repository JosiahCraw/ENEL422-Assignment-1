\subsection{Matched Reciever Eye Diagram}

The eye diagram of a signal comprised of 10,000 random bits is shown in Figure
~\ref{fig:eye-no-noise}, this example has a SNR$=\infty$.

    \label{fig:eye-no-noise}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Eye Diagram with a SNR=10dB}
As noise is added to the received signal the `eye' in the diagram will appear to close. 
This is because the opening of the eye shows the separations between the signal levels
at the ideal sampling instances but as noise is introduced the different levels become
harder to distinguish from each other, this is shown on the eye diagram as the `eye' 
starting to close. An eye diagram from a signal of 10,000 random bits and a SNR=10dB
can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:eye-noise}

\subsection{Bit and symbol errors}
I am unlikely to be able to accurately predict the bit error rate with $E_b/N_0$ of greater
than 10dB as the probability of the noise being large enough to cause a bit error is very
low, this means that a huge number of message bits would have to be simulated before any
bit errors could occur. This would cause the simulation to take far to long to complete
the simulation. To reliably predict the bit error rate the efficiency of the simpulation would
have to be increased or use greater computing power to simulate more data quickly.
