\subsection{Matched Reciever Eye Diagram}

The eye diagram of a signal comprised of 10,000 random bits is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:eye-no-noise}, this example has a SNR$=\infty$.
The ideal sampling instances are indicated by the red dashed lines, these are the points that the eyes are the most open. This means that
these points are sampling instances that have the most difference between the different levels and therefore that points that have the highest
noise tolerance.

\subsection{Eye Diagram with a SNR=10dB}
As noise is added to the received signal the `eye' in the diagram will appear to close. 
This is because the opening of the eye shows the separations between the signal levels
at the ideal sampling instances but as noise is introduced the different levels become
harder to distinguish from each other, this is shown on the eye diagram as the `eye' 
starting to close. An eye diagram from a signal of 10,000 random bits and a SNR=10dB
can be found in Figure ~\ref{fig:eye-noise}

\subsection{Bit error rate performance}
Figure~\ref{fig:bit-error} shows a simulation of 100,000 bits (50,000 symbols) that have
been pulse shaped, had noise applied then passed through a match filter with the bit errors
detected and the bit error rate plotted against the introduced noise. Figure ~\ref{fig:bit-error-10000}
shows the same data, this time with only 10,000 bits (5000 symbols) simulated. These plots
show that with only 10,000 bits the simulation is unable to detect any bit errors at 9 or
10 dB. However in the 100,000 bit simulation is able to dectect some bit errors at these levels.
This shows the scale of bits required to show bit errors at just 10dB.

\subsection{Bit and symbol errors}
A simulation unlikely to be able to accurately predict the bit error rate with $E_b/N_0$ of greater
than 10dB as the probability of the noise being large enough to cause a bit error is very
low, this means that a huge number of message bits would have to be simulated before any
bit errors could occur. This is shown above where 100,000 bits had to be simulated to detect any
bit errors for $E_b/N_0$ = 10dB. This would cause the simulation to take far to long to complete
the simulation. To reliably predict the bit error rate the efficiency of the simulation would
have to be increased or use greater computing power to simulate more data quickly.
