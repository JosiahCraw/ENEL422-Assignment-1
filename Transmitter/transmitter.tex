\subsection{Real World Implementation}

To meet the specifications the system must have a data rate of 1Mbps and a bandwidth of no greater then
500kHz. This results in a bit period ($T_s$) of $1\mu$s, As Nyquist pulse shaping is used the Nyquist
bandwidth is $B_w / 2 = 500\textrm{kHz}$. Using Nyquist pulse shaping allows data transfer over a
bandwidth limited channel such as the one given in the specifications. For real world use the ideal
Nyquist pulse cannot be used as it is not physically realisable due to the infinite frequencies 
contained within the sinc pulse produced in the frequency domain. This can be solved by not using
an ideal Nyquist pulse such as a root raised cosine or a raised cosine pulse as these have the same characteristics
as the Nyquist pulse where they are zeros at all time periods other than at `0', this stops a past symbol
from adding to the current signal .

\subsubsection{Binary Polar Signalling}
Binary polar signalling is a very robust signalling method as is has a high noise tolerance. This is
due to the large distance between the values for `1' and `0' this is advantageous when transmitting
over a noisy medium as the signal is less likely to have bit errors when it is received.
However, it has a much lower throughput compared to other options such as 4-PAM and 8-PAM. This transmission type also
will introduce distortion due to the bandwidth limitations of the channel as there will be tail frequencies that are
removed. The noise tolerance makes binary polar signalling suitable for wireless communications as this environment 
can have much more noise over a much further distance.


\subsubsection{4-PAM}
PAM signalling has the advantage of being able to transfer more data per signal period, in the case of 4-PAM
two data bits are transferred per symbol period. These bit are encoded in the amplitude of the pulse
the encoding is found in Table \ref{table:4-pam-coding}. This encoding allows 4-PAM to have double the transmission
rate of binary polar signaling. This extra bandwidth allows the Nyquist pulse to use more bandwidth to reduce the intersymbol
interference (ISI) of the system by using a Nyquist pulse with a higher roll off, reducing the impact of ISI for future bits
if the receiver samples incorrectly. 4-PAM however, has a lower noise tolerance when compared to binary polar signalling as
the distance between the symbols is less as there a more values period making the signal less noise tolerant.

\begin{table}[h]
    \label{table:4-pam-coding}
    \caption{4-PAM Encoding}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular} { | m{1cm} || m{1cm} | }
           \hline
           {`00'} & {-3} \\
           \hline
           {`01'} & {-1} \\
           \hline
           {`10'} & {1} \\
           \hline
           {`11'} & {3} \\
           \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
\end{table}
% 4-PAM is also a reasonably robust signalling method as there is still some noise tolerance as the different levels
% are reasonably well defined. This signaling method also allows double the data rate when compared to binary polar signalling.
% These properties make this method well suited to wired communication as noise is less noticeable in the signal as the medium
% can be controlled.

% 4-PAM is still usable in the real world, especially within a wired communication system. This is because the signal can be easily affected by noise as the amplitude
% spacing between `00' and `01' is smaller than the difference between binary polar signaling, assuming that the highest and lowest amplitudes are the same for both signals.
% However, 4-PAM provided greater data rates when compared to binary polar encoding as twice the number of bit can be sent in the same bandwidth.

\subsubsection{8-PAM}
8-PAM has the same advantages as 4-PAM in regards to throughput with double the levels of 4-PAM, 8-PAM is able to transmit 3
bits per symbol. This however, comes with worse noise tolerance than 4-PAM as the different levels are even closer together
this causes the signal to become much less noise tolerant than either 4-PAM or binary polar signalling.

\subsubsection{Recommedation}
Overall, 4-PAM best matches the requirements as it would have low distortion due to the excess bandwidth available to use a Nyquist pulse
with a high roll off factor. It also has higher noise tolerance when compared to 8-PAM and as the extra spectral efficiency gained through
8-PAM is not required by the specifications 4-PAM is the most suitable choice.

\subsection{Power Spectral Density of 4-PAM (Rectangular Pulse Shaping)}

The equation for the power spectral density (PSD) of a line code signal is shown in (\ref{eqn:psd-formula}) where $|P(f)|^2$ is
the energy spectral density of the pulse and $S_Y$ is the power spectral density of the data.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:psd-formula}
    S_Y(f) = |P(f)|^2 S_X(f)
\end{equation}

$S_X$ is defined as (\ref{eqn:sx}) where $R_n$ is the average of average power of all of the signal data levels as shown in
(~\ref{eqn:rn}).

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:sx}
    S_X = \frac{1}{T_s}[R_0 + 2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{R_n \cos 2 \pi n f T_s}]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:rn}
    R_n=\lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k}a_k a_{k-n}
\end{equation}

Assuming that the data is random the probability of each data level is equal.

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:ak-dist}
    P_{a_k} = 
    \begin{dcases}
        \frac{1}{4} \quad a_k = 3 \\
        \frac{1}{4} \quad a_k = 1 \\
        \frac{1}{4} \quad a_k = -1 \\
        \frac{1}{4} \quad a_k = -3
    \end{dcases}
\end{equation}

Therefore as $R_n$ is the average power of all data and each of the symbols is equally likely the average is
$R_n=0$ \\

As in the (\ref{eqn:ak-dist} the probabilities are equal for all $a_k$ therefore $a_k^2$ results in two equally likely 
options as shown in (~\ref{eqn:r0}),
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:r0}
    R_0 = \lim_{N\to\infty} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k} {a_{k}}^2 \quad \textrm{With,} \quad P_{{a_{k}}^2} = 
    \begin{dcases}
        \frac{1}{2} \quad a_k^2 = 9 \\
        \frac{1}{2} \quad a_k^2 = 1
    \end{dcases}
\end{equation}

Therefore as $a_k^2=9 \quad \textrm{or} \quad a_k^2=1 $ the average comes to,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:r0-value}
    R_0 = 5
\end{equation}

The required bit period can be derived from the required data rate.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:ts}
    T_b = \frac{1}{R_b} \quad \textrm{Therefore with a bitrate of 1Mbps,} \quad T_b = \frac{1}{1 \times 10^6}
\end{equation}

As 4-PAM has two bits per pulse $T_s = 2 T_b$ so $T_s = 2 \mu$s Therefore,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:sx-real}
    S_X(f) = \frac{1}{T_s} [5 + 0] \quad \textrm{For $T_s = 2\mu$s} \quad S_x=2500000
\end{equation}
\\
The rectangular pulse is defined as,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:pt}
    p(t) = \textrm{rect}(\frac{t}{T_s})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:pf}
    P(f) = T_s \textrm{sinc}(\pi f T_s)
\end{equation}

The equation for PSD is,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:PSD-4-PAM-rect}
    S_Y(f) = \abs{T_s \textrm{sinc}(f \pi T_s)}^2 S_x(f)
\end{equation}

So,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:sy-value}
    S_Y(f) = \abs{T_s \textrm{sinc}(f \pi T_s)}^2 (2500000)
\end{equation}
    
As shown in the PSD in Figure \ref{fig:psd-rect} the rectangular pulse signal has frequencies present outside
the bandlimits, the removal of these would result in a distorted signal. This shows that this signal does not meet
bandwidth specification.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Power Spectral Density of 4-PAM (Nyquist Pulse Shaping)}
The for the design of a Nyquist pulse a roll off factor of $\alpha = 1$ was used as there is adequate bandwidth
for the signal and the high roll off causes the tail oscillations of the pulse to fade more quickly, reducing the
chance of intersymbol interference (ISI)

The $S_x$ value is the same as above, using a root raised cosine pulse shaping the pulse is:

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:pf-w-niquist}
    P(f) =
    \begin{dcases}
        \frac{1}{4W} [1+\textrm{cos}(\frac{\pi f}{2W})] \quad \textrm{when} \quad 0<|f|<2W \\
        0 \quad \quad \textrm{when} |f| \geq 2W
    \end{dcases}
\end{equation}

Therefore $|P(f)|^2$ is,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn-pf2-nyquist}
    |P(f)|^2 =
    \begin{dcases}
        \frac{1}{16W^2}[1+\textrm{cos}(\frac{\pi f}{2W})]^2 \quad \textrm{when} \quad 0<|f|<2W \\
        0 \quad \textrm{when} \quad |f| \geq 2W
    \end{dcases}
\end{equation}

As $2W = \frac{1}{T_s}$,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn-pf2-nyquist-ts}
    |P(f)|^2 =
    \begin{dcases}
        \frac{T_s^2}{4}[1+\textrm{cos}(\pi f T_s)]^2 \quad \textrm{when} \quad 0<|f|<\frac{1}{T_s} \\
        0 \quad \textrm{when} \quad |f| \geq \frac{1}{T_s}
    \end{dcases}
\end{equation}

Therefore the power spectral density is,

\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:psd-nyquist}
    S_y(f) = \frac{5T_s}{4}[1+\textrm{cos}(\pi f T_s)]^2
\end{equation}

As shown is the PSD in Figure \ref{fig:fig-nyquist} there is no signal energy outside of the band limits
given in the specifications, this means that the signal will not be distorted when bandlimited. This shows
that using a root raised cosine pulse shape for a bandlimited channel will have better performance than
the rectangular pulse shaping in Figure \ref{fig:psd-rect}
